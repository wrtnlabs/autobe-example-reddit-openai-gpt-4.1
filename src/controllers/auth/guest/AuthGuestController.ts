   * Create and issue temporary guest identity (community_platform_guests).
   *
   * This endpoint allows a non-authenticated user (guest) to temporarily
   * register a guest identity for analytical tracking and session management
   * purposes. No credentials are required or issued; the system generates a
   * unique guest_identifier (e.g. cookie/session device ID), records optional
   * IP and user agent information, and logs the timestamp of guest
   * registration.
   *
   * The guest join flow enables the platform to attribute browsing and
   * engagement to unique visitors for analytics and security (e.g., preventing
   * abuse or spam) without associating a concrete email or password. The
   * related Prisma DB entity is 'community_platform_guests', which persistently
   * stores guest_identifier, IP address, and user agent for each unique guest.
   *
   * Guest join does not create any permissions for the guest to post, comment,
   * vote, join or leave communities, or create content. The guest is strictly
   * limited to read-only actions, as established in the business requirement
   * analysis and permissions matrix. Guests can view all public content and
   * browse communities, posts, and comments.
   *
   * Security is enforced via JWT tokens issued for guest sessions, scoped only
   * to permitted actions (read/view, not write or interact). If a guest
   * attempts to upgrade (register as member), a new member identity is created,
   * and their guest session is discontinued.
   *
   * Related ops: Guest token refresh (for prolonged browsing), member upgrade
   * (handled by member join, not guest). Session expiration and actions
   * requiring member privileges must trigger a login prompt.
   *
   * This operation is public and does not require authentication.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body No input needed. Guest identity is auto-generated and tracked
   *   based on device/session/cookie.
   * @setHeader token.access Authorization

  /**
   * Refresh access tokens for guest identity (community_platform_guests) using
   * refresh_token.
   *
   * This endpoint enables a guest user to renew their session by submitting a
   * valid refresh_token. The backend validates the refresh_token's association
   * with a guest identity in 'community_platform_guests', checks its expiry,
   * and then issues new session access credentials. All tokens are JWT, scoped
   * for guest activity, reflecting the guest_identifier.
   *
   * Guest session refresh ensures that non-authenticated browsing is
   * uninterrupted, preserving attribution for analytics and activity tracking.
   * Security verification verifies that the refresh_token is unexpired and
   * mapped to an active guest session record in the session management table.
   *
   * This operation does not grant, modify, or escalate privileges; it is
   * strictly for maintaining guest read/analytics session continuity.
   *
   * Security considerations include proper expiry and invalidation of tokens,
   * with protection against token replay and fixing. Session expiration still
   * requires the guest to re-initiate a join. Guests lack any write/interact
   * permissionsâ€”refresh simply restores their viewing capabilities for a longer
   * period.
   *
   * Related operations: Guest join (creates guest identity/session), session
   * invalidation on logout/expiration, member registration/upgrades handled
   * elsewhere.
   *
   * @param connection
   * @param body Request body containing the guest's valid refresh_token to
   *   issue a new session.
