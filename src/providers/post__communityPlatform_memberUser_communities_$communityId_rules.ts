/**
 * Create a new rule for a community (community_platform_community_rules table).
 *
 * This operation enables a community owner to add a new rule to their
 * communityâ€™s rule set as stored in the database. Only the owner of the
 * community may perform this action. The system enforces a maximum of 10 rules
 * per community and sequential rule_index. Rule text is validated per platform
 * and schema requirements. All date fields are serialized to ISO strings as
 * required by the API and business contract.
 *
 * @param props - Operation arguments
 * @param props.memberUser - JWT payload of the authenticated member user (must
 *   be the community owner)
 * @param props.communityId - UUID of the community to add a rule to
 * @param props.body - Rule creation DTO with rule_text (enforced <=100 chars)
 * @returns The created rule object (with id, community_id, rule_index,
 *   rule_text, created_at)
 * @throws {Error} If the community does not exist, is deleted, or the member is
 *   not the owner, or max rules exceeded
