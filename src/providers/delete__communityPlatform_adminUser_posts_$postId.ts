/**
 * Soft-delete an existing post in community_platform_posts by postId; only
 * allowed by author or adminUser.
 *
 * DELETE /posts/{postId} removes a post from user feeds and search by marking
 * the record as deleted (soft deleteâ€”sets deleted_at field) in
 * community_platform_posts. Only the author (memberUser/adminUser) or an
 * adminUser can delete. All underlying business checks for ownership,
 * existence, and non-previously-deleted status are enforced.
 *
 * Cascading application logic removes or marks as deleted dependent entities
 * such as comments or votes as per compliance rules. Attempted deletion of
 * non-owned posts by non-admins returns a permission error. Once deleted, the
 * post becomes inaccessible via normal queries, ensuring user privacy and
 * platform integrity. The operation does not return a body on success.
 *
 * @param props - Properties for the operation
 * @param props.adminUser - The authenticated admin user making the request
 * @param props.postId - The UUID of the post to be deleted (soft delete)
 * @returns Void
 * @throws {Error} When the post does not exist, has already been deleted, or
 *   cannot be deleted by the requester
