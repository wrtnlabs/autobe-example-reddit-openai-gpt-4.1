/**
 * Delete a specific community rule from a community the user owns.
 *
 * This endpoint allows the owner of a community to permanently remove a rule
 * from the community's rule set. The operation performs a hard deleteâ€”there is
 * no soft deletion or recovery for deleted rules. Only the community owner is
 * authorized to make this change; deletion attempts by non-owners are denied.
 *
 * After deletion, all remaining rules for the community are re-ordered to
 * ensure sequential rule_index values for display.
 *
 * @param props - Properties for this operation.
 * @param props.memberUser - The authenticated member user (must be the
 *   community owner).
 * @param props.communityId - The ID of the target community.
 * @param props.ruleId - The ID of the rule to delete.
 * @returns Void
 * @throws {Error} If the rule does not exist for the community
 * @throws {Error} If the community does not exist
 * @throws {Error} If the user is not the owner of the community
