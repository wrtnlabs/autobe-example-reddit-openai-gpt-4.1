/**
 * Create a new report about a post for moderation review
 * (community_platform_post_reports table).
 *
 * Create a new report regarding a given post, allowing members or admins to
 * flag inappropriate content, spam, abuse, or rule violations for moderation
 * review. The reporting user must be authenticated, and the target post
 * specified by postId. Request details must include a report_type for category
 * (such as spam, abuse, etc), a descriptive reason, and will be tracked under
 * 'open' status until reviewed. The operation enforces strict input validation:
 * report_type must match platform-allowed values, and reason must be non-empty,
 * up to 1000 chars (plain text). Only one report per post per member is
 * allowed; duplicate reports by the same member are rejected. Admins can also
 * create reports for escalated cases. Each report is associated with the
 * referenced post and the authenticated reporting user, allowing follow-up
 * workflow by moderators. Related APIs: PUT and DELETE operations for managing
 * reports, and admin moderation endpoints for escalations and resolution
 * management. Error handling covers permission issues (non-members/guests can't
 * report), invalid input, and business rule failures.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.postId Unique identifier of the target post being reported.
 * @param props.body Information for creating a report on a specific post,
 *   including report_type, reason, and status.
