/**
 * Create a new rule for a community (community_platform_community_rules table).
 *
 * This operation enables a community owner to add a new rule to their
 * community’s rules set, as stored in the community_platform_community_rules
 * table. Only the user who owns the target community may invoke this operation;
 * enforcement of ownership is critical per business logic. Upon execution, the
 * rule text is validated (up to 100 characters) and the rule_index is
 * determined based on the existing sequence (max 10 rules allowed).
 *
 * The new rule is stored with references to the community and its insertion
 * index, ensuring correct presentation order for UI and enforcement. Attempts
 * to add a rule when already at maximum count, or by a non-owner, will result
 * in an error. This endpoint integrates with safeguards ensuring that deletion
 * of a community cascades to all associated rules. Success returns the created
 * rule, including its unique ID, text, order, and metadata for proper list
 * display.
 *
 * Relevant for admins or owners managing community guidelines and transparency,
 * and for UI features showing live-updated rules lists after ownership
 * actions.
 *
 * @param props.connection
 * @param props.communityId ID of the community that will receive the new rule.
 * @param props.body Information for the new rule to insert (rule_text,
 *   automatic rule_index).
