/**
 * Ensure leaving a community with an invalid or already non-existent
 * membershipId fails as expected.
 *
 * This test simulates a registered member attempting to leave a community
 * using a random/fake membershipId. To set up, it first registers a member
 * account (providing a unique email and password), then creates a community
 * the member could join, and finally attempts to delete a membership record
 * that does not actually exist (random UUID for membershipId, valid
 * communityId). It asserts that the API should return an error (ideally 404
 * Not Found or equivalent) for trying to delete a non-existent membership.
 *
 * Step-by-step process:
 *
 * 1. Register a new member (for proper auth context).
 * 2. Create a new community owned by that member.
 * 3. Generate a random UUID as a fake membershipId (never joined or assigned).
 * 4. Attempt to leave (delete membership) with the valid communityId and the
 *    invalid membershipId â€” expect an error.
 *
 * Key points:
 *
 * - The leave operation must not succeed for non-existent memberships.
 * - Correct business error and status code are enforced.
