/**
 * Test that an unauthorized member cannot view the version history

 *
 * This test validates access controls on post snapshot history, ensuring
 * privacy and correct enforcement of author-only access rules.
 *
 * Workflow:
 *
 * 1. Register member A
 * 2. Member A creates a community
 * 3. Member A creates a post in the community
 * 4. Register member B (switches context to B)
 * 5. Explicitly login as member B to ensure authentication context
 * 6. Attempt to list post snapshots of member A's post as member B â€” this
 *    should fail with an authorization error
