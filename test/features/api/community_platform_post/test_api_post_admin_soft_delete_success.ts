/**
 * Test admin soft deletion of a member's community post (moderation
 * workflow).
 *
 * **Business Context:** This test validates that an admin can successfully
 * perform a moderation workflow, soft-deleting a post created by a regular
 * member. It simulates two roles: an admin (moderator) and a member (post
 * author). The scenario follows real-world practices of cross-role resource
 * management.
 *
 * **Step-by-step process:**
 *
 * 1. Register an admin (obtain admin authentication context)
 * 2. Register a member (for community/post creation privilege)
 * 3. Member creates a community for post context (with random category_id)
 * 4. Member creates a post within the community
 * 5. Switch authentication back to the admin
 * 6. Admin soft-deletes the member's post using moderation endpoint
 * 7. (Limitations) Due to limited access to GET/search endpoints, validation
 *    is restricted to business-contextual completion of the operation and
 *    error/permission handling; additional assertions would be possible
 *    with expanded API access.
 *
 * **Note:** In a full test suite, a read or search operation would be used
 * after deletion to confirm deleted_at is set and the post is not visible
 * in listing queries. Here, we ensure the operation completes without
 * errors and correct role boundaries are enforced for the mutation.
