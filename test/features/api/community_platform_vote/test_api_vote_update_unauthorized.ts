/**
 * Validate that a member cannot update a vote record they do not own
 * (unauthorized update attempt).
 *
 * Business context: Ownership enforcement in voting. The platform must
 * restrict updating vote records to the member who cast the original vote.
 * This test ensures that cross-account editing is strictly forbidden.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register and authenticate Member A (ownership context).
 * 2. Member A creates a vote (voteId is generated).
 * 3. Register and authenticate Member B (attempted unauthorized editor).
 * 4. Member B attempts to update the vote created by Member Aâ€”using the same
 *    voteId.
 * 5. Confirm that the update is rejected with an authorization/forbidden error
 *    using TestValidator.error().
