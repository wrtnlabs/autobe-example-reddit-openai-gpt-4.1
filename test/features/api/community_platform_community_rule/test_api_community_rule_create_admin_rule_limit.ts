/**
 * Validate enforcement of the maximum rules-per-community restriction for
 * admin users.
 *
 * This test ensures that when acting as an admin user, one cannot create
 * more than 10 rules for a single community, matching the business logic
 * applied to member users. The test walks through full setup of required
 * users and community, context switches to admin, and attempts to create 11
 * distinct rules. Each of the first 10 attempts should succeed (response
 * asserted), but the 11th attempt must fail, which is checked with an error
 * assertion.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register and log in a member user, and create a community (record id).
 * 2. Register and log in an admin user.
 * 3. As admin, repeatedly (10 times) add rules to the created community, with
 *    unique texts, asserting response each time.
 * 4. Attempt to add an 11th rule as adminâ€”expect this to fail and validate the
 *    error is thrown.

/**
 * Review for the test implementation:
 *
 * 1. The scenario is implemented as a comprehensive E2E test that validates that
 *    admin users are subject to the same maximum of 10 rules per community as
 *    member users, matching the business rule.
 * 2. User flow:
 *
 *    - Member user registration and login are handled explicitly, with clear
 *         credential construction and assertion.
 *    - Community creation uses the member user and unique name/category_id, using
 *         the correct DTO.
 *    - Admin user registration and login are performed, with proper role context
 *         switch.
 *    - The test loops 10 times to add 10 unique rules as admin, asserting index,
 *         rule text, and community_id for type/model compliance.
 *    - On the 11th attempt, the test uses TestValidator.error to assert that
 *         business rule enforcement occurs.
 * 3. Value generation uses RandomGenerator and typia.random appropriately,
 *    ensuring properly formatted and unique values.
 * 4. All TestValidator usages include a descriptive title as the first argument as
 *    mandated.
 * 5. All awaits, body typings, and type assertions follow framework rules.
 * 6. No forbidden patterns are present:
 *
 *    - NO type error testing or use of `as any`.
 *    - NO direct HTTP error/status assertion.
 *    - NO manual manipulation of connection headers, proper role switching via login
 *         APIs.
 *    - NO missing required fields or DTO confusion.
 *    - No extra import statements or template tampering.
 * 7. The code comment and function JSDoc provide context and detailed
 *    documentation aligned with the scenario and code steps.
 *
 * No issues were found.
 *
 * Final code is identical to draft and correct.
