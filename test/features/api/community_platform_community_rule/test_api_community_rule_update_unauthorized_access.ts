/**
 * Validate that a member cannot update a rule on a community they do not
 * own (unauthorized access).
 *
 * This test implements the following workflow:
 *
 * 1. Register Member 1 (community owner).
 * 2. Member 1 creates a community with random, valid properties.
 * 3. Member 1 adds a rule to their new community (valid rule line and index).
 * 4. Register Member 2 as a different, unique account.
 * 5. Switch authentication context to Member 2 (simulate user login as Member
 *    2).
 * 6. Member 2 attempts to update the rule previously created by Member 1
 *    (attempting to edit both rule_line and rule_index fields).
 * 7. Expect a permission/authorization errorâ€”Member 2 is not the owner, so
 *    update must fail.
 *
 * This test specifically verifies that authorization boundaries are
 * enforced for community rule updates: only owners or admins may update
 * rules. The negative test (error path) is considered passed if the API
 * properly rejects the update attempt. We never expect a successful
 * modification, only correct error handling.
