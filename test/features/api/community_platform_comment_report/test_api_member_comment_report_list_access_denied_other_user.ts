/**
 * Verifies that only the reporting member can access their own comment
 * report entries (not the original comment author).
 *
 * This tests security enforcement for comment report visibility, ensuring
 * that reports are visible only to the reporting member and platform
 * admins. The author of a comment cannot see reports filed by others
 * against their own comment.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register Member1 and register Member2 as distinct accounts.
 * 2. Member1 creates a comment (randomly assigned to a random post).
 * 3. Switch to Member2's auth context (registration auto-logs in).
 * 4. Member2 submits a report for Member1's comment (random valid
 *    reason/status).
 * 5. Switch back to Member1's auth context using their credentials.
 * 6. Member1 calls the report listing endpoint for their own comment.
 * 7. Validate that response data array is emptyâ€”Member1 does not see Member2's
 *    report.
