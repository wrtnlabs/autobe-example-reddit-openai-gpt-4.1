/**
 * Ensure only the report author can delete their own comment report
 * (ownership enforcement).
 *
 * Business purpose: Ensures that comment report deletion is tightly coupled
 * to report ownership, preventing any other member from erasing someone
 * else's report (except possibly an adminâ€”not part of this flow). This
 * supports privacy and auditability guarantees for platform
 * reports/complaints.
 *
 * Process:
 *
 * 1. Register member 1 (unique email, password, display name).
 * 2. Member 1 creates a new community (unique name/slug, minimum required
 *    fields).
 * 3. Member 1 creates a post in that community (title, body).
 * 4. Member 1 adds a comment to their post.
 * 5. Member 1 reports (files a report for) their own comment.
 * 6. Register member 2 (different unique email, password, display name).
 * 7. Member 2 attempts to delete the report submitted by member 1.
 * 8. The system must reject this attempt with an ownership/permission error
 *    (do not actually delete).
 *
 * Validation: Step 8 must throw an authorization/ownership error (e.g., 403
 * forbidden or similar), confirming the business rule enforcement. No
 * unauthorized deletions should succeed.
