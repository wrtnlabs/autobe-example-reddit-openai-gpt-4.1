 * Test successful deletion of an admin action (audit log) by its ID.
 *
 * 1. Register an admin user for authentication (acquire admin token).
 * 2. As the authenticated admin, create a new admin action to serve as the
 *    deletion target.
 * 3. Delete the created admin action by its ID.
 * 4. Confirm that the deletion API acknowledges successful removal (no
 *    error/void response).
 * 5. Attempt to delete the same admin action again, expecting an error, to
 *    verify true deletion and non-existence.
 *
 * This scenario demonstrates that admin action records can be hard-deleted
 * by privileged users, and that records once deleted are no longer
 * addressable in the audit trail by ID or duplicate deletion call.
