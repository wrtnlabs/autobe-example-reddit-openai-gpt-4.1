/**
 * Validate business logic and ownership for deleting post votes.
 *
 * This scenario covers both the happy path and business rules for vote
 * deletion:
 *
 * 1. MemberUser A registers, creates a community, and creates a post in that
 *    community
 * 2. MemberUser B registers
 * 3. B cannot vote on their own posts (attempt and expect error)
 * 4. B votes (upvote) on A's post and receives a vote ID
 * 5. B successfully deletes their own vote (expect success)
 * 6. Verify the voting state is removed (i.e., a new vote for B is possible)
 * 7. A attempts to delete B's vote (expect error — ownership enforced)
 *
 * Steps include both correct deletion and enforcement of business logic
 * (ownership and self-vote restriction).

/**
 * Review of the draft implementation:
 *
 * - API function usages and typings are all precise, only allowed functions and
 *   DTOs used.
 * - Correct handling of authentication via join, and role-based context simulated
 *   by sequencing of join.
 * - Properly generates random test data following tag constraints for email,
 *   uuid, paragraphs, etc.
 * - Each member registers using separate credentials; community and post are
 *   created by memberA.
 * - Attempt by B to vote on own post is checked with TestValidator.error, which
 *   is correct for business rule.
 * - Ownership of a vote is enforced: after B votes, B deletes their vote, a fresh
 *   vote is possible, and memberA cannot delete memberB's vote (error
 *   checked).
 * - Every TestValidator function uses a descriptive title.
 * - All API calls are awaited; operations inside error closures are awaited
 *   properly.
 * - No additional imports, and all code is in the correct section of the
 *   template.
 * - All typia.assert() usages are correct and focused on non-void responses.
 * - No type errors, type validation, or missing required/requested fields.
 * - No use of as any, require, non-existent properties, or fictional
 *   functions/types.
 * - All parameter constructions strictly follow the real DTO properties: no
 *   property mixing or speculation.
 * - No illegal connection.headers manipulation, no status code validation, no
 *   responses type checking after typia.assert, no illogical object
 *   operations.
 *
 * This code demonstrates strong TypeScript mastery, precise type safety,
 * correct error pattern testing, and clean null/undefined handling. No issues
 * found—final code is identical to the draft.
