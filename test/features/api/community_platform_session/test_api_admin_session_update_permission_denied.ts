/**
 * Review of Draft Implementation:
 *
 * 1. Compilation & Syntax:
 *
 * - Function strictly uses the provided template, and all TypeScript syntax and
 *   typia usages are correct.
 * - All api.functional.* calls have await.
 * - All DTO types and function signatures are used precisely as provided in the
 *   input materials.
 *
 * 2. Imports & Template:
 *
 * - No new or modified imports; the template is strictly followed.
 *
 * 3. Authentication Handling:
 *
 * - Test scenario uses only provided API authentication endpoints. There is no
 *   manual header/token manipulation.
 * - Proper context switching is established: join as admin, join as member, join
 *   as admin (to fetch sessions), join as member (to test permission denial).
 *
 * 4. Business Logic:
 *
 * - Test logic follows the user-journey required to establish correct session
 *   ownership and permissions context.
 * - There are no illogical operations: All user registrations and session
 *   accesses are in a logical, compliant order.
 *
 * 5. Permission Denial / Error Testing:
 *
 * - TestValidator.error is used with a descriptive title, in an async function
 *   with await.
 * - No type error testing, wrong types, or use of as anyâ€”error scenario is based
 *   on runtime permission denial, not compilation/type error.
 *
 * 6. Nullable/Undefined Handling:
 *
 * - Typia.assert() is used for all potentially nullable API output.
 * - No ! operator or forbidden as Type assertions. All checks use typia.assert or
 *   precondition logic as required.
 *
 * 7. Data Generation:
 *
 * - Random data is generated for emails and passwords, adhering to min/max
 *   lengths and formats.
 * - All DTO types (IJoin, IUpdate, IRequest) are satisfied using satisfies
 *   keyword; no type assertions are used.
 * - All request bodies use const and never let, and no variable is mutated or
 *   reassigned after creation.
 *
 * 8. Comments & Documentation:
 *
 * - Function-level documentation and step-by-step comments are highly descriptive
 *   and match the scenario plan.
 *
 * 9. Critical Await & Assertion Patterns:
 *
 * - All api.functional.* calls are awaited, including inside TestValidator.error.
 * - No missing awaits or bare Promise assignments.
 *
 * 10. Quality Checklist:
 *
 * - All checklist items are fulfilled, including zero additional imports, strict
 *   template use, proper type/invocation patterns, etc.
 *
 * Conclusion & Fixes:
 *
 * - No type error testing appears.
 * - All parameter order and assertion title conventions are strictly followed.
 * - No forbidden code detected; nothing needs to be deleted.
 *
 * Final code will be identical to the draft as there are no errors or
 * violations.
