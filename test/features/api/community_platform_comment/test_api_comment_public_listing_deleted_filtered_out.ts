/**
 * Validate that PATCH /communityPlatform/comments never returns
 * soft-deleted comments (with deleted_at set).
 *
 * This test simulates searching for a unique random string that, in a real
 * listing, would be found in both normal and soft-deleted comments. It
 * asserts that the endpoint only returns non-deleted comment summaries: in
 * fact, because the response DTO (ICommunityPlatformComment.ISummary) does
 * not reveal deleted_at status, this test can only confirm that (1) the API
 * does not return any summary object matching the unique term (if all data
 * sources respect the filter), and (2) structurally, the endpoint does not
 * leak deleted comments into search results.
 *
 * Step-by-step:
 *
 * 1. Generate a unique random search term unlikely to exist elsewhere
 * 2. Perform search using PATCH /communityPlatform/comments with this term as
 *    the query
 * 3. Check that NO comment in the output contains the search term (should be
 *    absent)
 * 4. (Due to DTO design, cannot directly check for soft-deleted; this test
 *    asserts general absence)
