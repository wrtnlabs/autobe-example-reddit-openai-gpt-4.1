/**
 * Test admin session refresh with an invalid, expired, or already-used
 * refresh token.
 *
 * Purpose:
 *
 * - Ensure that invalid, expired, or replayed refresh tokens are properly
 *   rejected by the admin refresh endpoint.
 * - Validate that, under all failure modes, no new JWT (access or refresh)
 *   tokens are issued.
 * - Confirm the response does not reveal token contents, admin account
 *   status, or session leak informationâ€”maintaining security best
 *   practices.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Construct a clearly invalid refresh token (random 64-character string,
 *    not associated with any session).
 * 2. Attempt to use this invalid token at the admin refresh endpoint
 *    (/auth/admin/refresh).
 * 3. Verify the endpoint throws an authentication error (e.g., 401
 *    Unauthorized, or a similarly secure generic error).
 * 4. Ensure no JWT tokens are issued in the response, and no
 *    security-sensitive details are disclosed, regardless of input reason
 *    (invalid/expired/replayed).
 *
 * This test acts as a security validation, confirming anti-replay and
 * non-disclosure guarantees for admin JWT refresh logic.
