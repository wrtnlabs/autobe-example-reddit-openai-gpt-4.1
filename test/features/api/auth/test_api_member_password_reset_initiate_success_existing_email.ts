/**
 * Test successful initiation of member password reset using a known email.
 *
 * Validates that when a password reset is initiated for an existing active
 * member, the system returns a non-leaking confirmation response without
 * revealing whether the email is registered. This test ensures business
 * rules for privacy are enforced.
 *
 * Steps:
 *
 * 1. Register a member account with a randomly generated (but known) email and
 *    password.
 * 2. Call the password reset initiation endpoint with this email.
 * 3. Assert that a generic confirmation message is returned (structure matches
 *    expected response DTO), and that no information regarding account
 *    existence is leaked.
