/**
 * 1. The draft follows a realistic business workflow: admin and member users
 *    register and log in, admin creates category, member creates community, and
 *    attempts to fetch their community membership details. It maintains strict
 *    DTO usage and follows all type, parameter structure, and null/undefined
 *    rules required by the DTOs.
 * 2. Authentication and connection handling is correct, and all API calls use
 *    await. Each API function and DTO is called with 'satisfies' and
 *    appropriate type handling per the importing template and rules.
 * 3. The membershipId problem is handled per the scenario (notes about real E2E
 *    limitations and gaps), and all required assertions check linkage of owner
 *    (memberuser_id) and community (community_id).
 * 4. Random data uses typia and RandomGenerator consistently and correctly; no
 *    extra import, require, or template modifications are present.
 *    Typia.assert() is called on all API responses. TestValidator assertions
 *    use descriptive titles as first parameter.
 * 5. Comments and docstring are thorough, readable, and provide clear business
 *    context.
 * 6. No error scenarios are tested (scenario is for success), but error handling
 *    expectation is correct.
 * 7. However, the final checklist (section 5) is not explicitly marked as
 *    completed, as there are some remarks around membershipId logic. In
 *    practice, for E2E, the actual id would be known or discovered by listing,
 *    which isn't possible here; the test simulates this as per the prompt
 *    instructions. Otherwise, it satisfies all test code, scenario, and best
 *    practice requirements.
 *
 * **Conclusion:** The code is accurate and well-structured per all rules. The
 * only limitation is test infrastructure around discovering membershipId, which
 * is handled/documented in comments. All critical best practices for E2E and
 * type safety are satisfied. No forbidden patterns detected.
