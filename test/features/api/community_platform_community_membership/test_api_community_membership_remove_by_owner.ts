/**
 * Review of draft implementation:
 *
 * - No additional import statements: All code inside the function, template
 *   untouched.
 * - Proper authentication role switching using admin/memberUser login flows, no
 *   manipulation of connection.headers.
 * - All API calls use await, no missing await anywhere (verified line by line).
 * - Only allowed DTOs and API functions used.
 * - Proper usage of typia.assert on all non-void API responses for type
 *   validation.
 * - Random data generation for email, password, category name, and community
 *   names uses generators and replacements for allowed DTO values and lengths.
 * - Correct request/response type-DTO matches: All body/object usages are precise
 *   for the endpoint. No DTO variant confusion.
 * - All TestValidator.* assertions include mandatory descriptive titles; no
 *   assertion is missing a title.
 * - All TestValidator assertions use actual-first, expected-second order.
 * - Comprehensive documentation: Multi-step JSDoc explaining each test business
 *   step.
 * - Each business-logic path (delete own membership, attempt deletion twice,
 *   deletion by wrong user, admin deletion on already-deleted) is handled and
 *   error-tested.
 * - No type error testing, no as any, no type safety violations.
 * - All nullable/undefinable fields explicitly set or handled, and data
 *   relationships are respected.
 * - Data flow is logical, with users created/assigned roles before each
 *   operation.
 * - TestValidator.error for async uses await.
 * - No missing required fields in any API call, all paths are covered.
 * - No response-type validation after typia.assert.
 *
 * Conclusion: Test code is a valid full E2E scenario for membership
 * self-deletion and related access control, with no violations detected.
 *
 * Final version is thus the same as the draft above.
