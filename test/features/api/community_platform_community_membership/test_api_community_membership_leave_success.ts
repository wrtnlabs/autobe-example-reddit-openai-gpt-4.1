 * 1. Register the owner (member1) and authenticate as them.
 * 2. As owner, create a community and retrieve communityId.
 * 3. Register a second member (member2) and authenticate as them (context
 *    switch).
 * 4. As member2, join the newly created communityâ€”get membershipId.
 * 5. As member2, call the leave (delete) endpoint to remove their membership.
 * 6. If deletion is successful (no error thrown), the operation is validated.
