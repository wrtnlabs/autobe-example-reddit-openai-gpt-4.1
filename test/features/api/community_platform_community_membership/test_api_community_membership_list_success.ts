 * 1. Register a new user (primary member â€” future community owner)
 * 2. Create a new community as this user
 * 3. Join the created community as the owner (initial membership)
 * 4. Register another member, join them to the same community
 * 5. Retrieve the list of memberships for the community using the PATCH API
 * 6. Validate both owner and additional member are present with correct
 *    records
