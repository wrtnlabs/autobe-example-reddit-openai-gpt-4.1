 * 2. Register an admin user.

 * 6. Delete the created member user's community using the admin delete
 *    endpoint.

/**
 * Code Review of Draft Implementation:
 *
 * 1. Import Compliance: Only allowed imports are used. No violations.
 * 2. Scenario Execution Flow: Member and admin are created, admin creates
 *    category, member creates community, admin deletes the community. Logical
 *    and business flow correct.
 * 3. Function Calls:
 *
 * - All API SDK calls use await correctly. No missing awaits found.
 * - All API calls use only the allowed SDKs in the provided input information; no
 *   fictional APIs or non-existent properties used.
 * - Typia.assert applied for all non-void API responses properly.
 * - All random data generation uses correct constraints/utility (typia.random,
 *   RandomGenerator...).
 * - Request bodies use satisfies with correct DTO types, as required.
 * - All I/O variable types are correct and compatible with SDK function parameter
 *   and response contracts.
 * - Proper switching between authentication states is handled strictly via
 *   provided SDK login/register calls (no header manipulation).
 * - No connection.headers manipulation at any point.
 * - TestValidator.predicate is used with a clear, descriptive title for the final
 *   check as required.
 *
 * 4. Type Safety & DTO Usage:
 *
 * - No as any or any type escaping present.
 * - No missing required properties or DTO confusion (ICreate used for creates,
 *   etc).
 * - All DTO types referenced exist and are correct.
 * - No wrong type data, all randoms have type args.
 * - No type error testing, no deliberate wrong types.
 * - Nulls and undefined are only used according to DTO (logo_uri, banner_uri are
 *   optional/undefined, per question's business goal).
 *
 * 5. Code Quality & Structure:
 *
 * - No extra helper functions; all logic is in main function.
 * - All validation and flow per business scenario.
 * - Variable naming clear, matches business context.
 * - Comments and documentation are clear and reference each step.
 * - All required business steps are present, and no circularity/logical error in
 *   action order.
 * - Strict one-actor-at-a-time API sequence. No concurrency that could require
 *   extra awaits or sequencing logic.
 *
 * 6. Disallowed patterns:
 *
 * - No HTTP status code checks, no error message comparison.
 * - No fictional properties or missing/null property injection.
 * - No type assertions or ! operator abuse.
 * - All code is in TypeScript and not Markdown or extra code blocks.
 *
 * No issues detected. Code is fully compliant with all provided instructions,
 * schema, and best practices.
