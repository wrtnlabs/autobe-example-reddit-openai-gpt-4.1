### `community_platform_categories`

Defines allowable sub-community categories across the platform. Each
category is referenced by community creation, enforcing business
constraints and search classification. Name is case-insensitive unique
and immutable after creation. Serves as a lookup for category selectors
throughout the platform.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.

  > Unique name of the category. Used for business logic and search
  > classification. Must be case-insensitive unique, 5-32 characters,
  > alphanumeric, hyphens and underscores allowed.
- `display_order`
  > Order for display in lists and UI selectors. Sequential integer starting
  > from 1.
- `description`
  > Optional description of the category for tooltips or context. Maximum 200
  > characters.
- `created_at`: Timestamp when category was created.
- `updated_at`: Timestamp when category record was last updated.

### `community_platform_configurations`

  > string, or number as string).
- `description`
  > Description of what this configuration controls and its effect. Max 200
  > chars for admin and logging context.
- `created_at`: Timestamp when configuration entry was created.
- `updated_at`: Timestamp of last update to value or description.

### `community_platform_audit_logs`

configuration changes, login events, and other system-critical
activities. Used for compliance review and security tracking. Logs
reference affected user or admin by id (nullable for system events).

- `event_detail`
  > Detailed text or JSON describing the event context and any data changed
  > (suitable for security review, up to 1000 chars).
- `ip_address`
  > Originating IP address (for security tracing, IPv4 or IPv6, may be
  > empty/null for automated/system events).
- `created_at`
  > Timestamp of log event creation. Audit trails require immutable time
  > records.

### `community_platform_sessions`

Stores all platform-issued JWT or OAuth session tokens and associated
metadata for all users. Each session tracks issue and expiry, IP/device
info, and status. Data is used for login management, concurrent device
enforcement, and forced logout tracing.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `user_id`
  > ID of the user (references any member/admin/guest as appropriate, must be
  > found in user tables). Flexible to support all user types.

### `community_platform_guestusers`

Defines unauthenticated guest user sessions tracked by the platform for
analytics and traceability. Records represent unique browser/device

```

### `community_platform_communities`

Table representing sub-communities within the platform. Each row stores
metadata and configuration for a single community: unique name, category
reference, description, visual assets (logo/banner), and rules (via
subsidiary table). The owner is an immutable reference to the user who
created the community. Only owners may update metadata except for
deletion, which may be performed by admin. Business constraints enforce
unique and valid names. Categories are referenced from
community_platform_categories. Supports full-text search on name and
description via GIN indexes. Deletion is soft (deleted_at).

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `owner_id`
  > Creator of the community. References {@link
  > community_platform_memberusers.id}.
- `category_id`
  > Category for this community. References {@link
  > community_platform_categories.id}.
- `name`
  > Unique, case-insensitive name of the community (5-32 chars, a-zA-Z0-9-_).
  > Immutable once set. Used as public identifier.
- `description`: Optional community description, up to 200 characters.
- `logo_uri`: Optional URI for community logo/image asset.

- `deleted_at`: Timestamp marking soft deletion, or null if active.

### `community_platform_community_memberships`

Table representing the many-to-many relationship between users and
communities. Each record marks the fact that a user is a joined member of
a given community. Used for membership enforcement, home feed
personalization, and recent communities logic. Entries may be created or
removed by users directly. Uniqueness enforced on (user, community).
Supports joined time and auditing.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `community_id`: Joined community reference. [community_platform_communities.id](#community_platform_communities).

  > User that joined this community. {@link
  > community_platform_memberusers.id}.
- `joined_at`: Timestamp when user joined this community.

### `community_platform_community_rules`

Stores the set of numbered rules for each community, used for
informational and business constraint display. Each rule is a text string
up to business limit; rules are always associated with a particular
community. Managed only through community settings flows, not directly by
end users. Deleting a community cascades deletion of its rules. Ordering
is enforced per-community with rule_index.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `community_id`: Parent community for this rule. [community_platform_communities.id](#community_platform_communities).
- `rule_index`: Order of this rule in display (starts at 1, max 10 per community).

- `created_at`: Timestamp rule was added.

### `community_platform_recent_communities`

Records the recent community navigation/activity for a member user, to
power personalized sidebars and navigation. Each entry links a user and a
community, with a recency ordering (recent_rank) and last_activity_at
timestamp. Not a membership table—distinct from
platform_community_memberships. Used for fast access/recall UI, managed
automatically by system logic. Max 5 recent communities per user enforced
via unique index.

Properties as follows:

- `id`: Primary Key.
- `memberuser_id`
  > User who recently navigated to a community. {@link
  > community_platform_memberusers.id}.
- `community_id`: Recently visited community. [community_platform_communities.id](#community_platform_communities).
- `recent_rank`
  > Rank/order of this community in recent navigation for this user (lower =
  > more recent, max 5 per user).
- `last_activity_at`: Timestamp this community was last visited by user.
