# External Integrations Requirement Analysis

## 1. Introduction
This document outlines the requirements for external integrations, third-party service interactions, and flows for exchanging data and authentication with outside systems, all supporting the extensibility and compatibility of the community platform.

## 2. Integration Principles
- THE platform SHALL support integration points that enable data exchange with external systems, third-party services, and evolving business needs.
- THE platform SHALL maintain clear separation of concerns between core community features and external integrations, ensuring the platform’s stability regardless of external service health.
- THE platform SHALL ONLY allow integrations that comply with platform privacy, security, and compliance standards.

## 3. Third-Party Services
### 3.1 Current Integrations
- As of this release, there are no mandatory third-party data or identity providers.
- THE system SHALL be architected so external service integrations can be added without requiring fundamental platform restructuring.

### 3.2 Potential Integrations
Potential integrations for extensibility and future compatibility include, but are not limited to:
- External Authentication Providers (Google, Facebook, Apple for OAuth/SSO)
- Email Delivery Services (e.g. SendGrid, Amazon SES) for transactional emails
- Media Storage/CDN (image uploads for profile or community assets)
- Analytics and Monitoring (Google Analytics, Sentry)
- Cloud Storage for backups and export

### 3.3 Integration Business Rules
- WHEN an external service is integrated, THE platform SHALL NOT expose end-user credentials to the external provider, except as strictly necessary (e.g., OAuth authorization code exchange).
- IF an external integration fails, THEN THE platform SHALL default to core features continuing to operate, logging errors and providing user-facing feedback where appropriate.
- WHERE external messaging (e.g., email) is used, THE system SHALL format and transmit all required content per business and compliance requirements.

## 4. Data Exchange Flows
### 4.1 Outbound Data Exports
- THE platform SHALL support exporting sub-community, post, or comment data in a standardized format (JSON or CSV) for external processing where explicitly authorized by users or administrators.
- IF a user initiates an export, THEN THE system SHALL validate authorization, process the export, and provide a secure download link.

### 4.2 Inbound Data Imports
- As of launch, THE system SHALL NOT support automated inbound data ingestion from external sources for untrusted data. All bulk data imports require administrator initiation and oversight with strict input validation.

### 4.3 Webhooks
- WHERE webhooks are implemented for outbound event notifications (e.g., new post, comment, user join), THE platform SHALL allow configuration of external endpoint URLs by admin users only.
- IF a webhook call fails, THEN THE system SHALL retry up to a defined limit and log the failure for admin audit.

### 4.4 Data Format and Validation
- THE platform SHALL use industry-standard data formats (e.g., JSON, OAuth2 tokens) in all integration interfaces.
- WHEN exchanging data with third parties, THE system SHALL validate payloads for completeness, conformance to schema, and absence of malicious content.

## 5. Authentication with External Systems
### 5.1 Outbound API Authentication
- WHEN the platform calls external APIs, THE system SHALL use secure authentication methods required by the external provider (API keys, OAuth2, signed requests).
- THE system SHALL NOT hardcode sensitive credentials; all secret keys must be managed securely and rotated routinely.

### 5.2 Inbound External Identity (OAuth/SSO)
- WHERE external identity providers are integrated, THE platform SHALL support common OAuth 2.0 flows for login and account linking, using provider best practices.
- WHEN a user authenticates with an external identity provider, THE platform SHALL create or update the user’s platform account using the minimum required data to preserve user privacy.
- IF an external identity token is invalid or revoked, THEN THE platform SHALL deny access and require re-authentication.

### 5.3 Token Mapping and Permissions
- WHEN importing external identity, THE system SHALL map external roles or permissions to the closest platform-equivalent capabilities, defaulting to memberUser for standard user logins.

  D --> E["Platform verifies token and reads basic profile info"].
  E --> F["Platform creates/updates local user, establishes session"].
  F --> G["User is authenticated and redirected appropriately"].
```

## 6. Security and Compliance Considerations
- THE platform SHALL comply with all applicable privacy and data protection standards (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) when exchanging data with external systems.
- THE platform SHALL log all outbound and inbound integration activity with sensitive audit trails accessible only to adminUser roles.
- THE platform SHALL not disclose personal or sensitive user data externally without explicit user or admin consent.
- WHEN handling media uploads via cloud storage/CDN, THE platform SHALL generate time-limited, permission-scoped URLs to prevent unauthorized access.
- THE platform SHALL require and enforce HTTPS/TLS encryption for all external service interactions.

## 7. Error and Exception Handling for Integrations
- IF an external integration fails (timeout, authentication, data format error), THEN THE system SHALL log the event, provide fallback UI or feature operation, and display a user-appropriate message if user action was directly impacted.
- WHERE critical integrations (e.g., identity provider) are temporarily unavailable, THE platform SHALL clearly communicate unavailability and recovery options to users.

## 8. Summary & Future Considerations
This document establishes a flexible yet robust baseline for all current and future external integrations, focusing on security, transparency, and resilience. New or expanded integrations should follow the same principles and be documented with a clear business purpose, data flow specification, error handling, and security review.
